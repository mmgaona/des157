   <p>Maps guide us to get somewhere need/want to be. The evolution of maps have become quite astonishing in our modern age. Maps have been applied to accommodate and explore almost anything. Maps are even being used as a platform for other maps. One form of map that I have found to be lacking in many instances are maps dedicated to accessibility, especially in academic institutions such as UC Davis. Accessibility maps are maps intended to mark buildings with accessibility access points and show their location according to each building. They are meant to help guide the user, whom is handicapped with disability, to find the best way to enter a building considering their disability. What is commonly found with most accessibility maps, however, is essentially an existing map with a handicap symbol pasted in an accessibility location of a building. While it is great that maps are offering inclusion for people with disabilities, they fall short on providing enough information for way-finding and guiding people with disabilities. They often lack vital information on the kinds of accessibility and where/how to operate them. Based on accessibility map examples from academic institutions such as, USC, UC Davis Mondavi Center, and the University of Kansas, one can see how they fall short. USC for example, has markers on their map indicating buildings with handicapped access. But that is all, there is no mention of where in the building or what kinds. Mondavi Center falls short as well, with the same issue of only providing minimal information. Looking at the map for the University of Kansas, there is improvement. The University of Kansas offers a map with a legend that shows multiple symbols of accessibility information. It shows clearly which buildings have accessibility areas with arrows pointing the user to a location on the building. It also color coordinates the buildings, depicting which buildings have some floors, all floors, or no floors reachable for the handicapped. The map the University of Kansas is what all accessibility maps should strive for. Yet, I believe there is still room for more improvements. The amount of information that the map the University of Kansas offers can be combined with interactivity to provide a better and more in-depth map for users with disabilities. Maps dedicated to accessibility are vital to an inclusive experience for those with disabilities. They deserve a better form of way-finding that those of us without disabilities take for granted.</p>
