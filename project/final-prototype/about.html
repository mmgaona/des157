<p class="about">Nowadays, mostly everyone in this modern age carries a map with them. We have maps at our disposal, in our pockets. Every smartphone is equipped with a map, or capable of displaying one. Maps have become a vital aspect of everyday phone use. For directions, finding a new restaurant, calculating distance, etc., maps are a staple to everyday modern life. Yet, those of us without a physical disability often take it for granted.<br><br>People with physical disabilities look at a map and a find a place they want to visit, just as people without disabilities do, but then they encounter another obstacle. They have to wonder, “Where is there an entrance which can accommodate a disability?” Most maps do not have this information readily available. While some contain icons depicting places with accessibility options, though mostly with much vagueness, there can be a lot more done to provide an inclusive map experience for those with disabilities.<br><br>
  When handicapped people, or people with a physical disability, visit a new building, they have to figure out how to enter it. While some maps kindly show them where to find an accessible entrance, they lack information on what kind of accessibility option is offered and how it functions. Even at academic institutions that promote diversity and inclusiveness, such as UC Davis, fall short on providing this crucial aspect on their maps for the handicapped/physically disabled. The goal of this project is to address that lack of information.<br><br>
  This project aims to provide accessibility information on per specific building. The user will be able to visit the site and it will display a map of UC Davis. Within the map, the user can find the building they would like to visit, click on it, learn about the accessibility options the building provides, such as: wheelchair ramps, automatic doors, door buttons, etc., and know where to find them. The building information will contain written descriptions as well as pictures of the building, with close ups on the accessibility points.</p>
